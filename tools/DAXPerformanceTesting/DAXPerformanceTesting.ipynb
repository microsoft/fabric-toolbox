    "# DAX Performance Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to measure DAX query timings under different cache states (cold, warm, and hot).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DAX Queries from Excel or YAML**  \n",
    "   - You must provide an Excel file containing the DAX queries in a table you wish to test.  \n",
    "   - For each query, a column needs align with the `runQueryType` used for a given `queryId`.  \n",
    "   - This notebook reads those queries and executes them on one or more Power BI/Fabric models.\n",
    "   - For Yaml files please refer to the `sample-yaml-dax-query-file.yaml` file in the media folder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lakehouse Logging**  \n",
    "   - You also must attach the appropriate Lakehouse in Fabric so that logs can be saved (both in a table and as files if you choose).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capacity Pause/Resume**  \n",
    "   - In some scenarios (e.g., simulating a \"cold\" cache on DirectQuery or Import models), the code pauses and resumes capacities.  \n",
    "   - **Warning**: Pausing a capacity will interrupt any running workloads on that capacity. Resuming will take time and resources, and can affect other workspaces assigned to the same capacity.\n"
